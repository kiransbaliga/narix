## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Ever felt that feeling sometimes, eventhough everything in your life seems fine and you are doing great but you still feel a little off?
You just feel okay and life seems not as exciting as before. Time seems to be moving so fast. On paper you are doing great but you still feel a little glump everytime.

let me explain

### Where it begins
I recently started working as a software developer at a cool [company](https://keyvalue.systems) after graduating B.Tech in 2023. 
Saying about my company, its a totally cool place. You have all the freedoms and have a family like work culture. You know almost every one of the 400+ employees in here. You get to learn a lot as well as get great exposure.

### Work life
Even though our office hours are quite flexible, I work from morning 9:30 AM to 6:30 PM. I do sometime come in early and stay late. I have never felt work pressure or anything. I take generous breaks in between so I rarely feel exhausted.  

### Social life
I live with 4 of my close [friends](https://instagram.com/devsoncoffee) from my college. I go to gym for 2 hrs in the morning or evening whenever I get the time. I play badminton with the my collegues in the night as well. I try to go out as much as I can. 

But here is the problem. As you can see, after setting aside time for gym and playing badminton, I only couple of hours left with me to do personal stuffs including cooking my own food. The first few months were exciting. New place, new lifestyle, you are earning, you buy stuffs. but lately all the stuffs started to feel a little grey. the routine make the life boring. I am not complaining, I have everything I could ask for, but sometimes I can't help but feel even though you are surrounded by a lot of people I still feel alone. I don't find many stuffs interesting. I started turning down many plans.
